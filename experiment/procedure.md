### Procedure

 1. Simulate ECG and observe the ECG pattern by varying P-wave amplitude.
 2. Simulate ECG and observe the ECG pattern by varying QRS-complex amplitude.
 3. Simulate ECG and observe the ECG pattern by varying T wave amplitude.
 4. Simulate ECG by adding 50Hz noise with different noise amplitudes.
 5. Simulate different abnormalities in ECG pattern.
 6. Simulate ECG for different heart rate.
